# Attempt at replicating machine learning technique of applying an image style to the content of another image.
This project is taken from the following tutorial:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/nst_blogpost/4_Neural_Style_Transfer_with_Eager_Execution.ipynb

Slight adjustments were made to run on my mac system. The purpose of this project was to get a cool introduction to tensorflow.js and machine learning techniques.  I do not claim any ownership of the code.
